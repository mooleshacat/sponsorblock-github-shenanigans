# Note about sponsorblock pettiness and Github GPL violation(s)

### Purpose
The purpose of this is not to ram through my ideas. The purpose of this is to highlight the pettiness and what I see as mismanagement on the part of sponsorblock, and also the GPL violations on the part of Github.

### Idea 1: full video fraud category

### Idea 2: per channel playback speed

### Sponsorblock pettiness / ban
For some reason out of all of this, I have received a ban from the sponsorblock Github repository. I am sure it is a repository ban and not Github ban, as my profile is still active on Github.

This pettiness prevents me from obtaining support, suggesting new features, communicating with the community, forking, starring, etc.

### Github GPL Violations
As a result of the sponsorblock repository ban, and the way Github is currently designed, I am unable to star or fork the sponsorblock repository. This is a clear GPL violation and while sponsorblock is the one responsible for the ban, they are not responsible for how Github is designed.

Github is directly violating the GPL on the repository owner's behalf by not allowing me to fork the code simply for being banned. Not being able to star the repository is just stupid and affects only the maintainer.

### My thoughts
While I will still use and recommend sponsorblock, I am definitely not going to donate to sponsorblock in the future. I don't like the pettiness. I don't like the lack of explanation or discussion before closing an issue that is a decent idea which others _may_ like. However they can manage their project how they like.
