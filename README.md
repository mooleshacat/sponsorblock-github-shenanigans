# Note about sponsorblock pettiness and Github GPL violation(s)

### Purpose
The purpose of this is not to ram through my ideas. The purpose of this is to highlight the pettiness and what I see as mismanagement on the part of sponsorblock, and also the GPL violations on the part of Github.

### Idea 1: full video fraud category
I saw as I was browsing the issue tickets a ticket about adding "scam" as a full video category. This caused me to think also a fraud category would be a good idea.

Issue ticket: https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/2197

The issue ticket was marked as "not planned" and closed without explanation or reply, without discussion with maintainer, and without discussion with the community.

### Idea 2: per channel playback speed
I found that I've been adding playback speed manually every time to a video. Considering one main reason people download sponsorblock is to save time, I figured adding a per-channel playback speed setting could save people even more time.

Issue ticket: https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/2198

This ticket was replied to by the maintainer, they said "Out of scope" then marked the ticket as "not planned" and closed the ticket - without discussion from the community.

IMHO this definitely is _not_ out of scope, considering one of the main reasons people download sponsorblock is to save time. While it is not _the_ main reason, it is _one of_ the reasons.

### Sponsorblock pettiness / ban
For some reason out of all of this, I have received a ban from the sponsorblock Github repository. I am sure it is a repository ban and not Github ban, as my profile is still active on Github.

Keep in mind, the ban was not for doing anything bad or wrong, but for simply submitting two ideas. Anyone who submits ideas or creates issue tickets for any reason is a possible target of this unjust and petty banning. If you ban users who submit ideas or suggestions, eventually you will not receive ideas or suggestions.

This pettiness and mismanagement prevents me from obtaining support, suggesting new features, communicating with the community, forking, starring, etc.

### Github GPL Violations
Sponsorblock currently uses a [GPL v3 license](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/blob/master/LICENSE)

As a result of the sponsorblock repository ban, and the way Github is currently designed, I am unable to star or fork the sponsorblock repository. This is a clear GPL violation and while sponsorblock is the one responsible for the ban, they are not responsible for how Github is designed.

Github is directly violating the GPL on the repository owner's behalf by not allowing me to fork the code simply for being banned. Not being able to star the repository is just stupid and affects only the maintainer.

### My thoughts
While I will still use and recommend sponsorblock, I am definitely not going to donate to sponsorblock in the future. I don't like the pettiness. I don't like the lack of explanation or discussion before closing an issue that is a decent idea which others _may_ like. I don't like the ban for simply suggesting ideas. However they can manage their project how they like.
